#  Project Sphinx

This is the first version of a web app for [St√∂r](http://www.storapp.io). The goal of this project is to buid an application that's fast, reliable and easy to use; we aim to turn the cumbersome process of storage, into a calm and pleasant experience. Through this process, we hope to annihilate the [competition](https://www.storewithneighbor.com) and make them look stupid.
